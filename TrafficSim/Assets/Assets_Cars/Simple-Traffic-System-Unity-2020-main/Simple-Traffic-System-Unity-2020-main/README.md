<p>How to create a simple traffic system for a city builder type of game in Unity 2020. This is not suited for Unity 2019 since I use attribute [field: SerializeField] to show UnityEvents in the inspector. It only works reliably on Unity version 2020 since they have modified the Serialization process.
